The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing."

        des: "As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your house, apartment, or other dwellings. If you want to use an appliance in your house, you plug it into a plug socket and it works. You don't try to wire it directly into the power supply — to do so would be really inefficient and, if you are not an electrician, difficult and dangerous to attempt."

        des: "Mobile applications have become big business in recent years; in fact, statistics show that 21 percent of millennials open an app more than 50 times per day. While there is no denying the popularity of apps, the sheer number of these custom software applications can make it difficult to see results when creating your own apps. With more than 2.2 million apps available for download in the Apple App Store, and an additional 2.8 million in the Google Play Store, it makes sense that your app will have to stand out if you want a lot of people to download it. In the end, it all comes down to app development."

They can help with various stages of development and have the versatility and time management to assist all levels of the development team. When it comes to web development, that role belongs to the Full Stack Developer. This is not a Back End or Front End developer, but someone who handles both — a “Full Stack,” as it were."

        des: "For a small business just trying to get a simple website up this could be a great option. You can buy pre-built themes anywhere from $40 – $65 on ThemeForest. Keep in mind, each one of these themes is very different and have their own caveats and learning curves. Once you’ve bought the theme, you will most likely still want to change around some elements and customize it to fit your needs which can take some time to learn since each one is proprietary and totally different."
